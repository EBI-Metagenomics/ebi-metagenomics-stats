# R Installation and setup scripts

## Debian 9 (stretch)

sh setupDebian.sh

Should install R and all necessary R packages on a clean Debian 9 (stretch) install.

## Fedora ?

```

Should install R and all necessary R packages on a clean Fedora ? install.

## RHEL 7

Running

```bash
sh setupRHEL.sh

**N.B. The script `installRRHEL.sh` will need editing to install R 3.4 somehow. See `installRFedora.sh` for ideas.**
